## Project Status

**Current Phase**: STANDALONE SAMPLER IMPLEMENTATION (Option A)
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-09 (Session continues)
**Overall Progress**: Implementation complete, ready for testing

✅ **ARCHITECTURAL REDESIGN IN PROGRESS** ✅

After completing reality check and research, implementing standalone sampler node as recommended in ASSESSMENT.md Option A.

### What's Been Done (This Session)

1. **Research & Planning**:
   - Created ASSESSMENT.md documenting architectural incompatibility
   - Created STANDALONE_SAMPLER_PLAN.md with detailed implementation steps
   - Created RESEARCH_NOTES.md with verified API documentation
   - Archived broken wrapper code to archive/ directory

2. **Implementation** (COMPLETE):
   - Created nodes/sampler.py - Standalone SDNQ sampler node (585 lines, fully featured)
   - Fixed nodes/__init__.py import error (was importing old loader)
   - Updated main __init__.py to load new sampler
   - All code based on verified APIs (NO assumptions)

3. **Features Implemented**:
   ✅ Model catalog dropdown (21 pre-configured SDNQ models from Disty0)
   ✅ HuggingFace auto-download with progress tracking and resume support
   ✅ Custom model path support ([Custom Path] option)
   ✅ Comprehensive error handling with helpful troubleshooting messages
   ✅ Graceful interruption support (InterruptedError handling)
   ✅ Widget tooltips (mouseover help for all parameters)
   ✅ ComfyUI V3 API compliance with V1 backward compatibility
   ✅ Pipeline caching for performance (avoids reloading same model)
   ✅ Detailed logging for debugging ([SDNQ Sampler] prefixed messages)
   ✅ Proper error categorization (ValueError, FileNotFoundError, Exception)
   ✅ LoRA support (local files and HuggingFace repos with strength control)
   ✅ Memory management modes (gpu/balanced/lowvram)

4. **Key Design Decisions**:
   - Using DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained() (auto-detects model type)
   - Using enable_model_cpu_offload() for memory efficiency
   - Pipeline caching to avoid reloading same model
   - Proper PIL to ComfyUI IMAGE tensor conversion (NHWC, float32, 0-1 range)
   - Integrated with existing core/ modules (registry.py, downloader.py, config.py)
   - Verified all APIs from official docs before implementation

5. **Bug Fixes** (Post user QA feedback):
   - Fixed core/__init__.py still importing wrapper.py (moved to archive)
   - Added structure validation test
   - Tested import chain properly before final commit
   - Fixed FLUX.2 negative_prompt parameter error
   - **CRITICAL**: Fixed CPU processing - was forcing CPU instead of GPU

### Lessons Learned - Quality Assurance

**CRITICAL LESSON #1**: Always validate the full import chain before claiming code is ready!

**What went wrong**:
- Moved wrapper.py to archive/ but forgot to update core/__init__.py
- Didn't test imports in a clean environment
- Claimed code was "production-ready" without proper validation

**How to prevent**:
- ✅ Created structure validation test (tests module imports without dependencies)
- ✅ Test import chain: main __init__ → nodes.__init__ → sampler → core modules
- ✅ Check for orphaned imports when moving/archiving files
- ✅ Never claim "ready" without running validation tests

**Note**: Can't test full imports in this environment (no torch/diffusers), but structure tests pass.

---

**CRITICAL LESSON #2**: Always check device placement - don't blindly follow old patterns!

**What went wrong** (Commit e0c1550):
- Used `enable_model_cpu_offload()` by default, forcing CPU processing
- Didn't verify device placement behavior for current versions
- Failed to learn from context.md (lines 124-157 documented this EXACT issue before)
- Failed to check archive code that worked correctly

**The facts** (December 2025, verified):
- `DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained()` loads to **CPU by default** (HuggingFace docs)
- Must explicitly call `.to("cuda")` for GPU processing
- `enable_model_cpu_offload()` is for **low VRAM systems** (12-16GB), not modern GPUs
- User has torch 2.9.x + CUDA 12.8 - should use full GPU mode

**How to prevent**:
- ✅ Read context.md FIRST - lessons are documented there
- ✅ Check archive code to see what worked before
- ✅ Research current best practices (don't assume from old docs)
- ✅ Verify device placement in console logs
- ✅ Added memory_mode parameter: "gpu" (default), "balanced", "lowvram"

**Sources verified**:
- [HuggingFace Diffusers Memory Optimization](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/optimization/memory)
- [DiffusionPipeline Loading Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/using-diffusers/loading)
- Context.md lines 124-157 (previous session documented this)

6. **LoRA Support** (COMPLETE):
   - Added lora_path and lora_strength optional parameters
   - Supports both local .safetensors files and HuggingFace repo IDs
   - Automatic LoRA loading/unloading based on cache changes
   - LoRA strength adjustment (-5.0 to +5.0, per user request)
   - Integrated caching: prevents unnecessary reloads when using same LoRA
   - Clears LoRA cache when model changes

7. **Memory Management** (UPDATED):
   - Changed default memory_mode to "balanced" (per user request)
   - Options: "gpu" (all on GPU, fastest), "balanced" (offloading, 12-16GB), "lowvram" (sequential, 8GB)
   - Proper GPU placement with .to("cuda") for "gpu" mode

8. **Scheduler Support** (ENHANCED):
   - Researched all available schedulers in diffusers 0.36.0 (December 2025)
   - **EXPANDED**: Now supports 14 schedulers (1 flow-match + 13 traditional)
   - Flow-based: FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler (for FLUX/SD3/Qwen/Z-Image)
   - Traditional: DPMSolver, UniPC, Euler, EulerAncestral, DDIM, Heun, KDPM2, DEIS, LMS, DDPM, PNDM
   - Implemented swap_scheduler() method with all scheduler mappings
   - Scheduler caching to avoid unnecessary swaps
   - See UX_IMPROVEMENTS_RESEARCH.md for comprehensive scheduler research

9. **Major UX Improvements** (COMPLETE):
   - **LoRA Dropdown**: Integrated with ComfyUI's folder_paths to show available LoRAs
   - **Default Negative Prompt**: "blurry, low quality, distorted, deformed, ugly, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, watermark, signature"
   - **Logical Parameter Ordering**: 5 clear groups (Model Selection → Prompts → Settings → Configuration → Enhancements)
   - **Multi-Model Scheduler Support**: Both flow-based and traditional diffusion schedulers
   - QA validated with test_ux_improvements.py (7/7 tests passed)

### LoRA Integration Details

**Dropdown Options**:
- `[None]`: No LoRA (default)
- `[Custom Path]`: Use lora_custom_path for manual path or HuggingFace repo
- Available LoRAs: Automatically populated from `ComfyUI/models/loras/`

**Path Resolution**:
- Uses `folder_paths.get_filename_list("loras")` to discover available LoRAs
- Uses `folder_paths.get_folder_paths("loras")` to build full paths
- Supports subdirectories within loras folder
- Falls back gracefully if folder_paths not available

**Parameters**:
- `lora_selection`: Dropdown with available LoRAs
- `lora_custom_path`: Custom path (only used when [Custom Path] selected)
- `lora_strength`: -5.0 to +5.0 (negative values invert effect)

### Scheduler Compatibility Matrix

| Model Type | Compatible Schedulers | Default |
|------------|----------------------|---------|
| FLUX/SD3/Qwen/Z-Image | FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler | FlowMatch... |
| SDXL/SD1.5 | DPMSolver, UniPC, Euler, EulerAncestral, DDIM, etc. | DPMSolverMultistep |

**CRITICAL**: Wrong scheduler type produces broken/corrupted images!
- Tooltip warns users about compatibility
- Default changed to DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (works with SDXL, most common in catalog)

### Parameter Organization

**GROUP 1: MODEL SELECTION**
1. model_selection
2. custom_model_path

**GROUP 2: GENERATION PROMPTS**
3. prompt
4. negative_prompt (now required with default value)

**GROUP 3: GENERATION SETTINGS**
5. steps
6. cfg
7. width
8. height
9. seed
10. scheduler (moved to settings, now visible to all users)

**GROUP 4: MODEL CONFIGURATION**
11. dtype
12. memory_mode
13. auto_download

**GROUP 5: ENHANCEMENTS** (Optional)
14. lora_selection
15. lora_custom_path
16. lora_strength

### Key Research Findings (Full Scheduler List)

**Flow-Based Models** (FLUX, SD3, Qwen, Z-Image):
- ✅ FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler (ONLY one that works)
- ❌ All traditional schedulers produce incorrect images

**Traditional Diffusion Models** (SDXL, SD1.5):
- ✅ DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (recommended, best speed/quality)
- ✅ UniPCMultistepScheduler (very fast, high quality)
- ✅ EulerDiscreteScheduler (simple, reliable)
- ✅ EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler (creative results)
- ✅ DDIMScheduler (classic, deterministic)
- ✅ HeunDiscreteScheduler, KDPM2DiscreteScheduler, etc. (10+ more options)
- ❌ Flow-match schedulers don't work with traditional models

10. **CRITICAL BUG FIX** (Post-UX Improvements):
   - **Issue**: FLUX.2 crashed when negative_prompt was provided (TypeError)
   - **Root Cause**: Default negative prompt added in UX improvements, but FLUX.2 doesn't support negative_prompt parameter
   - **Previous Behavior**: Hard crash with error message telling user to clear negative_prompt
   - **New Behavior**: Gracefully detects unsupported parameter, removes it, retries generation, logs warning to console
   - **Fix Location**: nodes/sampler.py:684-709 (try/except with retry logic)
   - **Impact**: With default negative prompt, FLUX.2 would crash on EVERY generation unless manually cleared
   - **User Experience**: Now seamless - FLUX.2 works out of the box despite having default negative prompt
   - **Console Output**: `⚠️  Pipeline Flux2Pipeline doesn't support negative_prompt - skipping it`
   - QA validated with test_negative_prompt_fix.py (7/7 checks passed)

### Graceful Parameter Handling

The node now implements intelligent parameter compatibility checking:

1. **First Attempt**: Try generation with all parameters (including negative_prompt if provided)
2. **Error Detection**: If TypeError about 'negative_prompt' occurs
3. **Automatic Retry**: Remove negative_prompt from kwargs and retry
4. **User Notification**: Log warning to console (non-intrusive)
5. **Success**: Generation continues successfully

This prevents crashes for:
- FLUX.2 (doesn't support negative_prompt)
- FLUX-schnell (cfg=0, ignores negative_prompt but accepts it)
- Future models with different parameter signatures

**Other unsupported parameters** still raise helpful errors with troubleshooting tips.

### Next Steps

- User to test node in ComfyUI (all fixes applied)
- Test LoRA support with real LoRA files (-5.0 to +5.0 range)
- Test scheduler parameter (currently only one option, but implemented correctly)
- Test model selection and auto-download with real SDNQ model
- Fix any errors discovered during testing

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES - GitHub Issue Resolution (2025-11-27 - Session 3)

### Issue #12: torch.compile Compiler Error ✅ FIXED (Commits: 661db1e, 0d9bc46)

**Problem**:
```
RuntimeError: Compiler: cl is not found
```

**Solution Implemented (Commit 661db1e)**:
1. Added automatic C++ compiler detection before model loading
2. Gracefully suppress torch.compile errors if compiler not found
3. Model still works with quantized weights (same memory savings, slightly slower)
4. Provides helpful setup instructions when compiler not available

**CRITICAL BUG FIX (Commit 0d9bc46)**:
Initial fix had a critical bug: `torch._dynamo.config.disable = True` was forcing CPU execution!

**What was wrong:**
- Setting `disable=True` completely disabled torch.compile
- SDNQ fallback path ran on CPU instead of GPU
- Model loaded into system RAM instead of VRAM
- User experienced slow CPU-only processing

**Proper fix:**
- **REMOVED**: `torch._dynamo.config.disable = True`
- **KEPT**: `torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True`
- Now torch.compile tries to compile, catches compiler error, falls back to GPU eager mode
- Model still uses GPU/VRAM (same memory usage)
- Only difference: No compiled optimizations (slightly slower than with compiler)

**SDPA OPTIMIZATION (Commit a7bb90b)**:
User pointed out: SDPA is better than eager and doesn't need compiler!

**What was improved:**
- Added `attn_implementation="sdpa"` to pipeline loading
- Model attention now uses SDPA (GPU-accelerated Flash Attention)
- SDPA doesn't require C++ compiler (unlike torch.compile)
- Much faster than pure eager mode

**Two separate optimizations:**
1. **SDPA** = Model attention (always fast, no compiler needed)
2. **torch.compile** = Weight dequantization (needs compiler, falls back to eager)

**Performance without compiler:**
- ✅ Attention: Fast (SDPA)
- ⚠️ Dequantization: Slower (eager fallback)
- 📊 Net result: Much better than full eager mode

**Status**: ✅ Fully optimized - Uses best available backend for each operation

---

### Issue #9: hf-xet>=1.3.0 not found ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Optional dependency marked as required, causing installation failures

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Removed `hf-xet` from main requirements.txt
2. Created `requirements-optional.txt` for optional dependencies
3. Updated README with clear optional installation instructions

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - hf-xet now properly optional

---

### Issue #15: Requirements Installation Conflicts ✅ FIXED

**Problem**:
- `huggingface-hub>=1.1.0` conflicted with transformers
- Duplicate transformers version specifications
- diffusers 0.36.0 not on PyPI

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Relaxed huggingface-hub to `>=0.20.0` (let dependencies resolve naturally)
2. Removed duplicate transformers entry
3. Changed diffusers to `>=0.35.0` with GitHub install instructions in comments
4. Updated README with conflict resolution guide

**Status**: ✅ Fixed - dependencies now resolve correctly

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: diffusers 0.36.0+ Breaking Changes (2025-11-27 - Session 3)

### AutoPipeline Removed in diffusers 0.36.0.dev0 ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: ImportError when loading models with diffusers installed from GitHub (0.36.0.dev0)
```python
ImportError: cannot import name 'AutoPipeline' from 'diffusers'
```

**Root Cause**:
- `AutoPipeline` class was **completely removed** in diffusers 0.36.0
- Only task-specific classes remain: `AutoPipelineForText2Image`, `AutoPipelineForImage2Image`, `AutoPipelineForInpainting`
- **NO video or multimodal AutoPipeline classes** exist

**Solution**: Changed to `DiffusionPipeline` (base class)
- `DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained()` auto-detects pipeline type from `model_index.json`
- Works with **ALL** model types: T2I, I2I, I2V, T2V, multimodal
- Supports FLUX, Qwen, video models (Wan2.2), everything

**Files Modified**:
- `nodes/loader.py`:
  - Line 19: `from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline` (was `AutoPipeline`)
  - Line 262: `pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(...)` (was `AutoPipeline`)
- `README.md`: Added critical section about diffusers 0.36.0+ requirement with GitHub install instructions
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies `diffusers>=0.36.0` (though 0.36.0 not yet on PyPI, must install from GitHub)

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and documented

**Important**: Users must install diffusers from GitHub until 0.36.0 is released on PyPI:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git
```

---

## ✅ PROPER FIX IMPLEMENTED (2025-11-27 - Session 3)

### Switched from State Dict Extraction to Wrapper Approach

**What Was Wrong**: Trying to force SDNQ quantized models through ComfyUI's native loaders
- Extracted state dicts from diffusers pipeline components
- Tried to pass to `comfy.sd.load_diffusion_model_state_dict()`
- Added bias injection hacks to fix missing keys
- All of this was fundamentally wrong for SDNQ models

**The Problem**:
```python
KeyError: 'x_embedder.bias'  # ComfyUI expects standard checkpoint format
RuntimeError: tensor size mismatch  # Quantized weights incompatible with bias
```

**PROPER FIX**: Use wrapper approach (as originally planned in CLAUDE.md)
- **REMOVED** (179 lines of hacks):
  - State dict extraction from pipeline components
  - Bias injection for missing keys
  - ComfyUI's `load_diffusion_model_state_dict()` calls
  - `_extract_clip_state_dicts()` helper method
  - `comfy.sd` import

- **ADDED** (32 lines of proper code):
  - Use `wrap_pipeline_components()` from `core/wrapper.py`
  - Keep diffusers pipeline intact with quantized weights
  - Apply SDNQ optimizations directly to pipeline components
  - Return wrapped MODEL/CLIP/VAE that implement ComfyUI interfaces

**Why This Is Better**:
- ✅ No monkeypatching or hacks
- ✅ Piggybacks on existing diffusers code (current versions)
- ✅ SDNQ quantized weights preserved in original format
- ✅ Wrappers implement proper ComfyUI interfaces (tokenize, encode_from_tokens, etc.)
- ✅ Minimal maintenance required
- ✅ Aligns with original CLAUDE.md architecture plan

**Pre-load Cleanup**:
- Runs before EACH model load (defensive cleanup)
- Clears gc, CUDA cache, torch dynamo state
- Ensures clean state even after failures
- Does NOT affect other workflows (only cleans before this node runs)

**Status**: ✅ Properly implemented, ready for testing

---

## MAJOR REFACTOR (2025-11-27 - Session 2)

### Complete Rewrite to Use ComfyUI Native Loading ✅ IN PROGRESS

**Issue**: Previous wrapper approach (SDNQModelWrapper, SDNQCLIPWrapper, SDNQVAEWrapper) was fundamentally broken:
- Didn't create proper ComfyUI ModelPatcher objects
- Missing `latent_format` attribute causing `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'latent_channels'` error
- Not compatible with ComfyUI's expected interfaces

**Solution**: Rewrote `nodes/loader.py` to use ComfyUI's native model loading functions:
1. Load SDNQ pipeline via diffusers (preserves pre-quantized weights)
2. Extract state dictionaries from transformer/unet, text_encoder(s), and VAE
3. Use ComfyUI's native loaders:
   - `comfy.sd.load_diffusion_model_state_dict()` → creates proper ModelPatcher with latent_format
   - `comfy.sd.load_text_encoder_state_dicts()` → creates proper CLIP object
   - `comfy.sd.VAE()` → creates proper VAE object
4. Apply SDNQ Triton optimizations to model inside ModelPatcher (optional)

**Key Changes**:
- Removed `core/wrapper.py` dependency (will delete file)
- Removed `cpu_offload` option (ComfyUI handles model management)
- Added `_extract_clip_state_dicts()` helper method
- Now returns proper ComfyUI MODEL/CLIP/VAE objects, not custom wrappers
- Quantized weights preserved through state_dict extraction
- Triton optimizations applied after ComfyUI loading

**Files Modified**:
- `nodes/loader.py`: Complete rewrite of load_model() method

**Status**: ✅ Implementation complete

### AutoPipeline Fix for Video/Multimodal Models ✅ COMPLETE (2025-11-27 - Session 2)

**Issue**: Code used `AutoPipelineForText2Image` which fails for:
- Video models (Wan2.2-I2V, Wan2.2-T2V)
- Multimodal editing models (Qwen-Image-Edit)
- Any non-T2I pipeline types

**Solution**: Changed to `AutoPipeline.from_pretrained()`:
- Auto-detects correct pipeline type from model_index.json
- Supports all pipeline types: T2I, I2I, I2V, T2V, multimodal
- **FLUX.2** → `Flux2Pipeline` (T2I with optional image guidance)
- **Qwen-Image-Edit** → `QwenImageEditPipeline` (requires input image + text)
- **Wan2.2-I2V/T2V** → Video pipelines with temporal components

**Research Findings**:
- FLUX.2 uses single Mistral Small 3.1 text encoder (vs FLUX.1's dual encoders)
- Qwen-Image-Edit uses dual-path architecture: Qwen2.5-VL + VAE Encoder
- All models still have transformer/unet components that can be extracted
- ComfyUI has native support for both FLUX.2 and Qwen-Image-Edit

**Files Modified**:
- `nodes/loader.py`:
  - Changed import: added `from diffusers import AutoPipeline`
  - Changed pipeline loading from `AutoPipelineForText2Image` to `AutoPipeline`
  - Removed unused `comfy.model_management` import
  - Added comprehensive comments about pipeline types

**Compatibility Note**:
- Video and multimodal models will load correctly via AutoPipeline
- Whether ComfyUI's `load_diffusion_model_state_dict()` recognizes all architectures needs testing
- FLUX.2 and Qwen-Image-Edit should work (ComfyUI has native support)
- Video model (Wan2.2) support in ComfyUI is unknown

**Status**: ✅ Fix implemented, needs user testing

### Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETE

**Changes**:
- Updated README.md:
  - Removed reference to CREDITS.md (now credits Disty0 directly in header)
  - Added modern model examples (FLUX.2, Qwen, Z-Image, HunyuanImage3)
  - Updated model count (21+ models)
  - Removed cpu_offload from parameters (no longer needed)
  - Updated Phase 3 status to complete
  - Added SDNQ Model Quantizer documentation
  - Removed inaccurate VRAM estimates
  - Updated troubleshooting section
- Removed CREDITS.md file
- Updated context.md with complete session history

**Status**: ✅ Documentation complete

---

## Lessons Learned

### ComfyUI Type System
- **Wrapper Strategy**: Created wrapper classes (SDNQModelWrapper, SDNQCLIPWrapper, SDNQVAEWrapper) that hold references to the full diffusers pipeline
- **Model Component**: Can be either `transformer` (FLUX/SD3) or `unet` (SDXL/SD1.5)
- **Integration Point**: Wrappers provide methods like `get_model()`, `get_pipeline()` for ComfyUI to access underlying components
- **Key Insight**: Instead of trying to perfectly mimic ComfyUI's internal types, we wrap the diffusers components and trust that ComfyUI nodes can work with them

### SDNQ Integration
- **Import Side-Effect**: Simply importing `from sdnq import SDNQConfig` registers SDNQ into diffusers - no manual registration needed!
- **Transparent Loading**: Models load via standard `diffusers.AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained()` - SDNQ detection is automatic
- **Optimization**: `apply_sdnq_options_to_model()` applies Triton quantized matmul when available
- **Memory Management**: `enable_model_cpu_offload()` provides additional VRAM savings

### Diffusers Pipeline
- **Pipeline Components**:
  - `transformer` or `unet`: Main diffusion model
  - `text_encoder` + `tokenizer`: Text encoding (CLIP/T5)
  - `vae`: Image encoding/decoding
  - `scheduler`: Noise scheduler (internal to pipeline)
- **Detection**: Check for `hasattr(pipeline, 'transformer')` vs `hasattr(pipeline, 'unet')` to determine architecture
- **Local vs Remote**: Use `local_files_only=True` for local paths, `False` for HuggingFace downloads

---

## Code Snippets to Remember

### Basic SDNQ Loading Pattern
```python
from sdnq import SDNQConfig  # Registers SDNQ
import diffusers
import torch

# Load pipeline
pipe = diffusers.AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained(
    "Disty0/FLUX.1-dev-qint8",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    local_files_only=False
)

# Apply optimizations
from sdnq.loader import apply_sdnq_options_to_model
pipe.transformer = apply_sdnq_options_to_model(
    pipe.transformer,
    use_quantized_matmul=True
)

# Enable CPU offload
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()
```

### Wrapper Usage
```python
from core.wrapper import wrap_pipeline_components

model, clip, vae = wrap_pipeline_components(pipeline)
# Returns (SDNQModelWrapper, SDNQCLIPWrapper, SDNQVAEWrapper)
```

## Session Log

### 2025-11-26 - Session 1: Initial Implementation
**Goal**: Set up project structure and implement Phase 1 MVP

**Achieved**:
- ✅ Created complete folder structure
- ✅ Implemented all Phase 1 core modules:
  - `core/config.py` - Configuration helpers
  - `core/wrapper.py` - ComfyUI type wrappers (MODEL, CLIP, VAE)
  - `nodes/loader.py` - SDNQModelLoader node with full functionality
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation:
  - `README.md` - User guide with installation, usage, troubleshooting
  - `CREDITS.md` - Proper attribution to Disty0
  - `pyproject.toml` - Modern packaging configuration
  - `install.py` - ComfyUI Manager integration
- ✅ Created placeholder modules for Phase 2 & 3:
  - `core/registry.py` - Model catalog (basic version)
  - `core/downloader.py` - HuggingFace Hub downloader (placeholder)
  - `nodes/quantizer.py` - Checkpoint quantization (placeholder)
  - `nodes/catalog.py` - Model catalog display (placeholder)

**Issues**: None - development went smoothly!

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Wrapper Approach**: Created lightweight wrapper classes that hold pipeline references rather than trying to perfectly mimic ComfyUI's internal types
2. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error messages with troubleshooting hints
3. **Phase Strategy**: Implemented full Phase 1 with placeholders for Phase 2/3 to establish clear roadmap
4. **Documentation First**: Wrote comprehensive README before testing to clarify user experience

**Next Session**:
1. Deploy to a ComfyUI instance for testing
2. Test with real SDNQ model (Disty0/FLUX.1-dev-qint8)
3. Validate wrapper compatibility with KSampler and other nodes
4. Fix any issues discovered during integration testing
5. Consider Phase 2 implementation based on test results

### 2025-11-26 - Session 2: Phase 2 Implementation
**Goal**: Add convenient model dropdown with automatic downloading

**Achieved**:
- ✅ Expanded model registry to 9+ SDNQ models with complete metadata:
  - FLUX variants (qint8, qint6, qint4, schnell)
  - SD 3.5 models (Large, Large-Turbo, Medium)
  - SDXL models (base qint8, base qint4)
  - Each with VRAM requirements, download size, quality estimates
- ✅ Implemented full HuggingFace downloader:
  - Progress tracking with size/speed display
  - Smart caching (checks if model already downloaded)
  - Resume support for interrupted downloads
  - Parallel download threads (8 workers)
  - Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Updated SDNQModelLoader node with dropdown:
  - `model_selection` dropdown with formatted names (includes VRAM info)
  - Auto-download on first use
  - Custom model support via `--Custom Model--` option
  - Model metadata display in console
  - Cache detection and reuse
- ✅ Updated core package exports for all new functions
- ✅ Updated README with Phase 2 features and new workflow examples
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect dropdown usage

**Issues**: None - implementation went smoothly!

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Model Dropdown Format**: Display as "ModelName [VRAM]" for easy selection
2. **Caching Strategy**: Use HuggingFace Hub's built-in caching via `try_to_load_from_cache`
3. **Download Progress**: Print to console (ComfyUI UI integration would require more work)
4. **Model Priority**: Added priority field to catalog for recommended ordering
5. **Custom Model Option**: Added `--Custom Model--` dropdown entry for flexibility

**New Features Summary**:
- 📦 9+ pre-configured models in dropdown
- ⚡ Automatic download from HuggingFace on first use
- 💾 Smart caching - download once, use forever
- 📊 Model metadata display (VRAM, size, quality)
- 🔧 Custom model support for advanced users

**Next Session**:
1. Test dropdown functionality in real ComfyUI
2. Test auto-download with real internet connection
3. Verify caching works correctly
4. Test with multiple models
5. Consider Phase 3 features (quantization node, LoRA support)

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Approach Works

1. **No Monkeypatching**: SDNQ integrates via diffusers registration, so we don't need to modify ComfyUI core
2. **Pipeline-Centric**: We keep the full diffusers pipeline intact and expose components through wrappers
3. **Flexible Wrappers**: Wrappers provide both high-level (`get_pipeline()`) and low-level (`get_model()`) access
4. **Type Detection**: Dynamic detection of model architecture (FLUX vs SDXL) via `hasattr()` checks

### Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Type Compatibility**: ComfyUI may expect specific methods/attributes on MODEL/CLIP/VAE that our wrappers don't provide
   - **Mitigation**: Wrappers expose underlying components via getter methods
2. **Memory Management**: Diffusers CPU offloading vs ComfyUI's model management
   - **Mitigation**: Made cpu_offload optional, users can disable if conflicts arise
3. **Scheduler Compatibility**: ComfyUI may want to override the scheduler
   - **Mitigation**: KSampler can access scheduler through pipeline
4. **Text Encoding**: CLIP wrapper's `encode()` method may not match ComfyUI's expected interface
   - **Mitigation**: Simple wrapper, easy to adjust based on testing
