**Load and run SDNQ quantized models in ComfyUI with 50-75% VRAM savings!**

This custom node pack enables running [SDNQ (SD.Next Quantization)](https://github.com/Disty0/sdnq) models directly in ComfyUI. **This repository implementation is developed specifically for FLUX.2 only**. Run FLUX.2 models on consumer hardware with significantly reduced VRAM requirements while maintaining quality.

> **SDNQ is developed by [Disty0](https://github.com/Disty0)** - this node pack provides ComfyUI integration.

> **⚠️ Important**: **This repository is developed specifically for FLUX.2 only**. While SDNQ technology supports other large-scale models (FLUX.1, Qwen Image, etc.), this implementation focuses on FLUX.2. Other models have not been tested.

## Modular Node Structure

This fork provides a **modular node structure with split functionality**. The following nodes are implemented:

- **SDNQ Model Loader**: Dedicated node for loading models
- **SDNQ LoRA Loader**: Dedicated node for loading LoRAs (also available as **SDNQ LoRA Stacker V2** in [ComfyUI-NunchakuFluxLoraStacker](https://github.com/ussoewwin/ComfyUI-NunchakuFluxLoraStacker) with dynamic 10-slot UI)
- **SDNQ VAE Encode**: Dedicated node for encoding images to latent space (compatible with diffusers VAE)
- **SDNQ Sampler V2**: Dedicated node for image generation (general models)
- **Flux2 SDNQ Sampler V2**: Dedicated node for image generation (Flux2-optimized)
- **Flux2 SDNQ TorchCompile**: Performance optimization node using PyTorch 2.0+ torch.compile for faster inference

This allows you to use SDNQ models with the same workflow structure as standard ComfyUI workflows (Model Load → LoRA Apply → Sampling).

---

## Installation

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
git clone https://github.com/ussoewwin/comfyui-sdnq-splited.git
cd comfyui-sdnq-splited
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation.

### Installation via ComfyUI Manager

This custom node is also available via ComfyUI Manager. However, if you encounter the following error:

```
With the current security level configuration,
only custom nodes from the "default channel" can be installed.
```

This is due to ComfyUI's security level restrictions. Newly registered nodes are not automatically in the "default channel" until they gain wider adoption. This is **not an error with the repository or registry registration** - the node is correctly registered and functional.

**Solutions:**

1. **Lower ComfyUI Security Level** (Recommended)
   - Go to ComfyUI Settings → Security Level
   - Change from "Strict" to "Normal" or "Disabled"
   - Then try installing via ComfyUI Manager again

2. **Install via Git URL** (Always available)
   - In ComfyUI Manager, use "Install via Git URL"
   - Enter: `https://github.com/ussoewwin/comfyui-sdnq-splited`

### Flux2 SDNQ Sampler V2

**Category**: `sampling/SDNQ/Flux2`

**Purpose**: Flux2 models (FLUX.2-dev, FLUX.1-dev, etc.) with specialized optimizations for Flow Matching architecture.

**Main Parameters**:
- `model`: Input from SDNQ Model Loader or SDNQ LoRA Loader (must be Flux2 pipeline)
- `prompt`: Text prompt for generation
- `steps`, `cfg`, `seed`: Standard generation controls
- `latent_image`: Latent input from SDNQ VAE Encode (supports i2i workflows)

### Flux2 SDNQ TorchCompile

**Category**: `SDNQ/torchcompile`

**Purpose**: Performance optimization node that uses PyTorch 2.0+ `torch.compile` to accelerate Flux2 model inference. Compiles the transformer blocks to optimize computation graphs, resulting in faster generation speeds after an initial compilation phase.

**Main Parameters**:
- `model`: Input from SDNQ Model Loader or SDNQ LoRA Loader (MODEL input)
- `backend`: Compilation backend
  - `inductor`: Default PyTorch Inductor backend (recommended)
  - `cudagraphs`: CUDA Graphs backend
- `mode`: Compilation optimization mode
  - `default`: Balanced speed/compile time
  - `max-autotune`: Best for latency (uses inductor + CUDA graphs, recommended)
  - `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs`: Max optimization without CUDA graphs
  - `reduce-overhead`: Good for small models
- `fullgraph`: Enable full graph mode (may conflict with accelerate hooks, default: False)
- `double_blocks`: Compile double blocks (default: True)
- `single_blocks`: Compile single blocks (default: True)
- `dynamic`: Enable dynamic mode for variable input shapes (default: False)

**Optional Parameters**:
- `dynamo_cache_size_limit`: torch._dynamo.config.cache_size_limit (default: 64)
- `force_parameter_static_shapes`: torch._dynamo.config.force_parameter_static_shapes (default: True)

**Outputs**: `MODEL` (connects to Flux2 SDNQ Sampler V2 or SDNQ Sampler V2)

**Supported Model Types**:
- DiffusionPipeline (comfyui-sdnq-splited SDNQ models)
- Nunchaku Flux2 models (ComfyFluxWrapper)
- Standard ComfyUI Flux models

**Performance Notes**:
- **First Run**: Compilation overhead (~30-60 seconds) - compiles the computational graph
- **Subsequent Runs**: Uses cached compiled version for faster inference
- **Expected Speedup**: Approximately 30% faster generation on subsequent runs after compilation (tested results)
- Works best with `mode="max-autotune"` for maximum performance

**Important**:
- This node must be placed between Model Loader/LoRA Loader and Sampler nodes
- Compilation is verified automatically - check console logs for confirmation
- If compilation fails, the node will raise an error (ensure PyTorch 2.0+ is installed)
- Only compiles transformer blocks - other layers are not compiled (for stability)

**Note**: This node is for FLUX.2 models only. Other models have not been tested.

---

## Available Models

**FLUX.2 models only** - Other models have not been tested.

Pre-configured FLUX.2 models include:
- FLUX.2-dev (various quantization levels)

Models are available in uint4 (max VRAM savings) or int8 (best quality). Browse SDNQ quantized models: https://huggingface.co/collections/Disty0/sdnq

**⚠️ Important**: **This repository supports FLUX.2 models only**. While SDNQ technology supports other large-scale models (FLUX.1, Qwen Image, etc.), this implementation focuses on FLUX.2 only. Other models have not been tested.

---

## Performance Tips

**For All Memory Modes**:
- SDPA (Scaled Dot Product Attention) is always active - automatic PyTorch 2.0+ optimization
- **TorchCompile**: Use Flux2 SDNQ TorchCompile node for performance boost (approximately 30% faster on subsequent runs after initial compilation, based on test results)
  - Place between Model Loader/LoRA Loader and Sampler
  - Use `mode="max-autotune"` for best performance
  - First run will be slower (30-60s compilation), subsequent runs are approximately 30% faster
- Enable the xFormers option in the UI (safe to try)
- Enable the Flash Attention (FA) option in the UI - faster inference and lower VRAM
- Enable the Sage Attention (SA) option in the UI - optimized attention computation
- Use `enable_vae_tiling=True` for large images (>1536px) to prevent OOM

**⚠️ Important**: For Flux2 models, xFormers, Flash Attention (FA), and Sage Attention (SA) have **no effect** - these optimizations are not applicable to Flux2's architecture. Use TorchCompile instead for performance improvements.

**Scheduler Selection**:
- FLUX.2: Use `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler` (only scheduler supported)
- Wrong scheduler = broken images!

## Model Storage

Downloaded models are stored in:
- **Location**: `ComfyUI/models/diffusers/sdnq/`
- **Format**: Standard diffusers format

Models are cached automatically - download once, use forever!

---

## Troubleshooting

### xFormers Not Working

If you see "xFormers not available" but have it installed:
- This is usually fine - the node automatically falls back to SDPA (PyTorch 2.0+ default)
- SDPA provides good performance without xFormers
- If xFormers is incompatible with your GPU/model, fallback is automatic

### Out of Memory

1. Use lower memory mode (gpu → balanced → lowvram)
2. Use more aggressive quantization (uint4 instead of int8)
3. Reduce resolution or batch size
4. Enable `enable_vae_tiling=True` for large images

### Model Loading Fails

1. Check internet connection (for auto-download)
2. Verify repo ID is correct for custom models
3. For local models, ensure path points to directory (not a file)
4. Check model is actually SDNQ-quantized (from Disty0's collection)
